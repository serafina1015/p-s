-3D print model

[Part to Whole - Global to Local](http://keanmgc.github.io/2021fall3yr-studio/)

Export the glass removed model from rhino into another rhino file, adjust the size to 1:30, change the unit to mm, and check and modify the too thin parts in the building through the instruction thickness analysis. At the same time, it is best to connect all parts of the model accurately. Because I asked the 3D printing merchant on Taobao to help me print the model, the exported STL format file can be printed, and the merchant will help me remove the redundant support structure. If I print in the school printer, I need to disassemble each part to ensure that each part contacts the ground, and connect each part together after printing.
