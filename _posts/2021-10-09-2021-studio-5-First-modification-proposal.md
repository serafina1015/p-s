Modification content:

1. Add a platform at the door.

2. Change the line of the middle revolving door into a dotted line, but it is the best choice to replace it with another door, because although the revolving door is beautiful, it occupies the middle position and is inconvenient to pass. Moreover, in order that the revolving door does not interfere with other spaces, the length of the aisle needs to be increased. If it is replaced with other doors, the length of the aisle can be reduced, so as to save space.

3. Add the section view and the section line in the plan view. To show the details of the building.

4. Show the principle of projection, for example, the wooden door in the plan and the wooden door in the section are on the same side.

5. Use line drawing for elevation.

6. The photos are not beautiful when stacked together.

7. The photo lacks the surrounding environment

8. The connection between water and soil in the photo is unnatural and needs to be modified.

9. The original two photos show both sides of a pipe. It needs to be changed into one photo to cover both sides.

10. The colors in the photos are too complex.

11. Add the fixed structure of climbing vine plant rack

12. There needs to be a road connection from the building gate to the road, not the lawn.

13. Remove the meaningless background picture.

14. Remove the ladder, because the large area of glass is not very supportive for people to go up, and other tools can be used.

15. Draw plants on the vine rack.

16. Show the three states of the wooden door.

17. Increase the glass structure because the area of the skylight is too large to use only one piece of glass.

18. Increase the tilt angle of the glass, perhaps only 1 degree, in order to let the rain leave the roof.

19. Modify the site plan, use line drawing and use other shapes.

20. Add dimension drawing of concrete pipe and inspection well.
