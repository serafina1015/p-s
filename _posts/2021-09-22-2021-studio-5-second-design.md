three pipe with big inspection well in "T" shape

[Part to Whole - Global to Local](http://keanmgc.github.io/2021fall3yr-studio/)

explanation of the first detailed design：

This design introduces an inspection well that has not been used before, because the connection of large pipelines can be cross connected in addition to horizontal connection, but the existence of inspection well is required. The existence of the inspection well provides the connection mode, the role of windows and doors, and separates pipes in different directions. The space of the inspection well is used as the public space and the bedroom (patio), and the three pipes at the edge are used as the study, toilet and kitchen respectively. The whole building is placed by the river, and the shaded area can be used as a yard. When designing the plan, I ensured the visual field accessibility of the middle space as much as possible. What's special is that I move the cabinet in my study to the middle public space, and then drag the bed out of the cabinet to realize the function conversion from public space to bedroom. Another thing that can be hidden is the middle table, which achieves the purpose of rising by rotating the equipment in the middle of the table. The ground next to the table is storage space, which benefits from the overhead space about 50cm higher than the ground of the inspection well. In order to align the edge of the bed with the direction of the door, I moved the pipe in the lower right corner to the inspection well for a certain distance, wasting a little space and an interesting space. This space was used in the third design. The most cautious thing is that when I designed the plan, I considered the height of the furniture and the distance between them and the widest edge, but this can not let me experience the space in the design, so I made a model to better complete the design in the third design, in order to let the residents have a better space experience.

Areas for improvement:

I didn't know the specifications of the inspection well carefully in advance, which was the fatal point to stifle the design. After careful study, I found that the inspection well specifications I used were not mass-produced and needed to be customized, which meant that they were expensive.
