Floor Area (in both m² and sf):
	≈36m²
  
Interior Volume:
	24.74m²
  
Site Address/Type:
	The area around Jordan River Peace Labyrinth
  
Material/Construction/Assembly:
	Concrete pipe and Inspection well
  
Typical Owner:
	Youth（maybe Just started working）

My project uses concrete pipes and an inspection well (not customized), which can be recycled. The inspection well in the middle serves as the function of bedroom, study, and public space, two 3M inner diameter pipes are left as the kitchen and bathroom, and two pipes with an inner diameter of 2m are required to connect and separate each function as the space of the door, due to the limitation of the specification of the pipe well. This arrangement also provides an interesting new idea, that is, the 2m inner diameter concrete pipe limits the view of residents in the inspection well to the 3M inner diameter pipe and hides the furniture in the 3M inner diameter pipe. In addition, planting plants above the 2m inner diameter pipe can provide green scenery for the residents in the 3M inner diameter pipe. In the space above the inspection well, I arranged glass as a skylight, and residents can climb to the top through the outer wall to carry out activities. In the middle inspection well, the corner space beside the 2m pipe serves as a bookshelf and wine rack. Beyond the linear space of the pipe with an inner diameter of 2m is the space for bed and desk. The bathroom compartment and the washing machine are particularly placed in the toilet space on the right. The washing machine uses the space at the edge of the pipe, and the water supply pipes of the bathroom and the washing machine are hidden through the space below the washing machine. A space similar to the balcony is reserved outside the toilet, which also ensures a certain degree of privacy. Finally, I sink the building into the ground, which can not only stabilize the structure, but also the green plants on the windows of the inspection well can serve as the continuation of the external environment and create a more natural space experience for the bedroom (The windowsill is at the same height as the ground). The windowsill facing south can also be used as a reading space. The bathroom door in my building is made of wood. When it is opened, it will be like a rotating staircase. When half closed, it acts as a window for ventilation. I also set up a rack of vine climbing plants above the kitchen, so that residents can choose what to grow, such as grapes. In addition to my building, there are also some additional pipes that can be used as social space, including rocking chairs, multi-person dining tables and children's play space.
