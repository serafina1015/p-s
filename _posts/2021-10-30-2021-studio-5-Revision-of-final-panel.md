-Revision of final penal

[Part to Whole - Global to Local](http://keanmgc.github.io/2021fall3yr-studio/)



Modified content:

What I am most satisfied with this modification is that the landscape map at the window is added to the line painting, which shows the architectural feature - circular landscape. In addition, I added 4 photos of 3D printing model.

(管居) Guanju Pipe Dreams

The concrete pipe and inspection well used as building shell are large-scale prefabricated parts with low cost and easy construction (Affordability). 30000 (3m pipe) + 28000 (inspection well) + 8000 (2m pipe) + 1300 (1.5m pipe) + 200×23 m² (Floor planks) + 1500 (Water pipes and wires) + 300×40 m² (tempering glass) + 70×12m² (Solar shutter) =86240 RMB≈13464.5 dollar (If more concrete pipes are needed, the price will drop a lot.)

On both sides of the building are concrete pipes with an inner diameter of 3M, which serve as kitchens and toilets. In the middle is the inspection well as the bedroom and public space (bedding can be put away). Functional partitions are linearly distributed, which is easy to navigate in the building by the clear and open line of sight. (Livability) The 3M inner diameter concrete pipe and the inspection well are connected and separated by 2m inner diameter concrete pipe. 2m inner diameter pipes are also served as the space of the door, using air conditioning curtain in front of supermarket due to the limitation of the specification of the well. This arrangement also provides an interesting new idea, that is, the 2m inner diameter concrete pipe limits the view of residents in the inspection well to the 3M inner diameter pipe and hides the furniture in the 3M inner diameter pipe. Plants above the 2m inner diameter pipe can provide green scenery for the residents in the 3M inner diameter pipe. At the top of the inspection well, I arranged a glass with an angle of 2 degrees as a skylight. Below this, I arranged sunshades and solar shutters (Sustainability). It's corner space beside the 2m inner diameter pipe serves as a bookshelf and wine rack. The space under the bed hides a lifting table, and the rest is storage space. The pipe facing south (1.5m inner diameter), which is used as bedroom’s window, can be used as a reading space. In the toilet, the washing machine uses the space at the edge of the pipe, and the water supply pipes of the bathroom and the washing machine are hidden through the space below the washing machine. The arc space below the floor serves as a channel for circuits and water pipes. The bathroom door in my building is made of wood. When it is opened, it will be like a rotating staircase. When half closed, it acts as a window for ventilation. A space similar to the balcony is reserved outside the toilet, which also ensures a certain degree of privacy. I also set up a rack of vine climbing plants above the kitchen, so that residents can choose what to grow, such as grapes. There are drains on both sides of the building to prevent rainwater from pouring back, and discharge the waste water in the building at the same time (Accessibility).

What’s more, I sink the building into the ground to a certain height, which can not only stabilize the structure, but also the green plants on the windows of the inspection well can serve as the continuation of the external environment and create a more natural space experience for the bedroom (The windowsill is at the same height as the ground). (Durability) 

In addition to my building, there are also some additional pipes that can be used as social space, including rocking chairs, multi-person dining tables and children’s play space. (Livability)

The site I chose is located near Jordan River Peace Labyrinth （a grassland）, close to a river. The use of daylight is optimized by using plastic air conditioning curtain, skylight and transparent facade. (Livability) 

Buildings and surrounding public spaces are easy to build and dismantle. The building can also be changed into a double room by adding pipes or inspection wells according to the customer's requirements. (Accessibility) Concrete pipes and inspection well used in buildings can be recycled and reused. Recycled wood is used. (Sustainability) Mortar rock wool composite board is used as insulation material. (Livability)
