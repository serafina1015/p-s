its disadvantages after experience：

This design and most of the previous sketches missed the special significance of the material of concrete pipe - it does not need to spend too much time and money to build, but only need to be reasonably connected, because in these designs, the concrete pipe needs to be cut too much, and this cutting is difficult to do. It is better to use other materials. In addition, in the layout of furniture, the toilet and bathroom block the view, and it is a bad choice to put the toilet and kitchen too close. The bed is not long enough, and the kitchen, bathroom and toilet are too small. The space between the two doors is too wasteful. The most important thing is that the requirements of the competition specify the bathroom space, toilet and a sink, but there is no sink in the toilet I designed.
