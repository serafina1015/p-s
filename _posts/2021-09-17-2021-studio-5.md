combination of concrete pipes

[Part to Whole - Global to Local](http://keanmgc.github.io/2021fall3yr-studio/)

The idea of the sketch below is to overlap two concrete pipes, and the space in the middle is used as a bed. Some bookshelves or small storage space can be placed in front of and behind the bed. The space under the bed can be used as a fireplace. A flat walkway is required at the bottom of the concrete pipe, and the lower part of the walkway acts as a storage space.

The idea of the following sketch is to tilt the concrete pipe into contact with the water surface in the form of a water pipe. Cut the position contacting the water horizontally and replace it with glass, which will form a triangular area that can be used by people when it is very hot during the day and serve as a public space (if two people live in the house). This space will not only provide river scenery, but also provide river scenery.

The idea of the following sketch is to horizontally overlap three concrete pipes to create five spaces, namely, the space of two beds, the private space on both sides, and the public space in the middle. The feature of this idea is to use the space of the bed to divide the private space and the public space.

The idea of the following sketch is to horizontally overlap two concrete pipes into the form of gears to create three spaces. The space in the middle can be used as a place to place things, and it is also a place to closely connect the two concrete pipes (for example, insert a wooden board in the middle so that the two concrete pipes cannot be separated unless the wooden board is removed).
