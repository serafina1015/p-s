Definition：
   A home needs the most basic items, including toilet, bed, kitchen, public space, and storage space, which meet people's living requirements. Except that the space where the bed is located (not necessarily a complete room, with wardrobe and bedside table...) needs complete privacy, other spaces can be shared with family. At the same time, it should have a certain degree of comfort and meet the decoration preferences of the owners of the home.
