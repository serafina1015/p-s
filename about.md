This is Serafina Yuan Xuting, a third-year student in Whenzhou Kean University.


There are two projects this semester, one is to design a tiny house or an ADU, and the other is to combine my own tiny house with my partner's tiny house to design a building complex.

The house I designed is composed of different sizes of concrete pipes and an inspection well;

My partner Martha's house is a transportable wooden house, which consists of four parts.

The theme of our project:

In modern times, due to the continuous expansion of cities, there is often a clear dividing line between high-density residential areas and natural areas. The purpose of this design is to blur the boundary between architecture and nature while attracting more young people to leave the noisy city and return to nature in their spare time. From high-density multi-storey multi-functional buildings near the village to sporadic single-storey residential areas, this total building complex is gradually spreading to the forest behind.
